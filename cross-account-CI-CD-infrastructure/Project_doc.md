<h2 align="center">Project Summary</h2>
By the end of the project, you will have accomplished the following:
ðŸ‘‰ Created a fully managed AWS cross-account CI/CD pipeline
ðŸ‘‰ Deployed a secure, highly available & scalable multi-tier web app
ðŸ‘‰ Developed an ECR image for your pipeline
ðŸ‘‰ Enforced vulnerability scanning and error detection in the pipelineÂ 
ðŸ‘‰ Emailed Infrastructure cost usage reports from your pipeline
ðŸ‘‰ Received Slack notifications for the status of your pipelineÂ 
ðŸ‘‰ Setup email notifications for ASG scaling events and Cloudwatch alarms
ðŸ‘‰ Generated reports for errors and vulnerabilities for the terraform code


.....Insert 3 tier webapp architecture

## Deployment Pre-requisites
- Knowledge of Terraform, AWS, Python, Docker, Shell scripting

- Two AWS accounts and an IAM user with admin permissions.
- AWS CLI (2.2+) installed and configured for both accounts
- Access to the project files on my GitHub repo
- Email address for pipeline notifications
- Registered domain name

========================Pipeline add-ons=====================
Slack notifications
You will receive Slack notifications once the pipeline is triggered, and receive requests for manual approval or pipeline execution completes. A sample notification is shown below

Slack NotificationsTest reports 
Each CodeBuild project generates test reports. For example, the screenshot below shows a summary of the success rate of test cases for the security scans run by Checkov.

Â Last but not least my favorite, the pipeline generates the snippet cost report shown below using Infracost. You can view the full report here
